# Seismologic Observatory

Code made by [me](https://github.com/ishiikurisu) while studying at the Seismologic Observatory from the University of Brasilia.

## Index ##

### ["Real" Data](real-data)

This folder is an experiment for generating and analysing a "real" dataset, as if I were obtaining data from the real world.

### [Synthetic Data](synth-data)

The idea of this part of the code is to analyze the "real" data with a known geophysical analysis process.

### [Amplitude Picking](amps)

Here, I want to analyze the collected data myself, opening the relevant files and performing the computations on my own instead of relying on 3rd party software.

### Stuff

The [example](example) and the [stuff](stuff) folders have some random code that help me complete my tasks.
